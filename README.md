# FOE_Discord_Bot

Discord bot to integrate with the FOE website. To run you need the following things:

An environment with the required python packages installed.
An environment with the DISCORD_TOKEN, BOT_PASSWORD, and BASE_URL environment variables set.

I use a docker-compose for mine, but a venv could work as well. If you need to use the dotenv library feel free to add it.
